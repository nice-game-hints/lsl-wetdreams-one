Dufus (in Timber) is a reference to *Rufus* from Deponia series. There are guides for all of the four Deponia games here in Nice Game Hints.

If you want to play Deponia, with great spoiler free hints, and support me, the guide writer, please buy the game from Greenman Games using this [affiliate link](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100219050-13658755?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdeponia%2FUS&cjsku=PADBD226C4DF).
