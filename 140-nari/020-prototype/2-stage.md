In the second stage the prototype is tested against a saw blade.

# How to protect it?
Ask it. You have to test it without protection first.

# An armor?
What would be a suitable armor for an amazon?

# Don't know?
Haven't you read any roleplaying books? Or looked at older fantasy movies?

# No... nerd...
Ever heard of bikini chainmail?

# I saw one!
There is one at the Hell's Pawn VIP area. Go fetch it. 

# I have it
Now you can put the chainmail on the prototype and test it (pull the lever). It will stand against the saw!
