In the third stage the prototype is tested against radiation.

# How to protect it?
Ask it. You have to test it without protection first.

# Her brain...
The radiation is killing her brain. Find someone who believes in impossible.

# Impossible?
Conspiracy theories are quite impossible.

# So...
Go talk to Smokey Bear about conspiracy theories.

# He gave me tinfoil
Protect the prototype with tinfoil and test it (pull the lever). It will block the radiation!
