In the fourth stage the prototype is tested against laser.

# How to protect it?
Ask it. You have to test it without protection first.

# Reflect light?
You have been carrying it with you...

# What?
The mirror!

# Oh, right...
Protect the prototype with the mirror and test it (pull the lever). It will reflect the laser!
