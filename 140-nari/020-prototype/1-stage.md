In the first stage the prototype is tested against fire.

# How to protect it?
Ask it. You have to test it without protection first.

# Something cold?
A beer?

# Haven't seen a beer since the beginning
Right. Something else then. Have you visited the QuikiMart? ^[ It is in the Leisure Suite's back room. ]

# Yeah?
Well, there is the slushy machine. Slushy is quite cold, isn't it?

# True!
Grab yourself a frozen slushy.

# It smelts!
If you would just have a container to keep it cold.

# Like?
There is a thermal jug in front of Prune HQ. Put the slusy into it to keep it cold.

# It stays cold
Now you can put the prototype into the slushy and test it (pull the lever). It will withold fire!
