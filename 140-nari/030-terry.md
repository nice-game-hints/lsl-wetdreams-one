Nari would nerd out with you really good. The last nerdy thing she wants you to do for her is to get her a copy of Treasure Loot Terry (the name sounds oddly familiar).

# Where do I find it?
Where do all the old retro games end up? Before they reboot.

# Interesting hint
If you find yourself back where you started I think you might find other retro stuff, also.

# Lefty's
No! In the very beginning. Get back to that [old laboratory](/080-old-lab/index.md) you started from.

# I found the game!
Get it to Nari. Now, you just need [a room](/020-leftys/060-room.md).
