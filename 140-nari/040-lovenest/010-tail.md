Should I now tell you how to build a unicorn tail?

# Yes.
Tail should be in the lower part of one's body.

# Yes?
So, it means that the tail will be inserted in... ummm...

# Yes?!
...butt?

# Yes!
With what? Do you have a buttplug with you? ^[ There is a chess piece that looks like a puttblug at the funfair. ]

# Yes!!
How about the tail part? You would need unicorn hair.

# Yes!?!
They sell those in QuikiMart. Are you Prune employee with the PrunePal?

# Yes!!!
Attach the unicorn hair to the butt-chess-piece.

# Yes!!!!
Come on... Insert the unicorn tail plug into Nari's butt.

# Yes!!!!!
Don't you have anything else to say?

# No!!
fin.
