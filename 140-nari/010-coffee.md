title: Getting coffee for Nari
---

This is probaby the most challenging part of the game. Nari wants, listen closely, a _tall hot stiff vanilla latte_.

# Okay
So, think about all the places that serve coffee.

# Salon de LÃ©zard
Yeah. Go ask them for latte.

# Too expensive
Right, how about Lefty's?

# He doesn't serve lattes
You are probably right. What else...

# Are you just pullin my leg?
No, this is a really hard puzzle. Don't you get my hints?

# No!
Okay okay... The magic word is stiff (tihihi).

# No it is not!
Vanilla?

# I'm getting it from the coffee machine
The one at the Prune office. But that would be too _easy_. Let's come up with something, please.

# No, I'm doing it
No, don't...

# Hey!
You got it? You took it from the machine? Is it hot? Is it vanilla? And stiff?

# It is!
Did you just give it to Nari?

# I did
Well, good on you. I just wrote twelve hints for you, in vain! Enjoy your coffee.
