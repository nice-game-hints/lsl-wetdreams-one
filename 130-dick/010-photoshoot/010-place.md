Dick wants to take a professional photo of Larry. You just need a perfect place for that.

# What place?
Suggest some the places you have visited to him.

# Nothing is good
You are probably missing a place. Have you talked wih Lemma?

# Yes
Go [find her drummer](/130-lemma/010-drummer/010-find.md), first.

# Found him
Isn't the Pier 69 just the perfect place? Go suggest that to Dick.
