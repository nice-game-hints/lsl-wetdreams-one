Dick wants to take a professional photo of Larry. You just need [a perfect place for that](010-place.md).

# He wont' leave
His old flame is still at the Pier 69. After you [clear that up](020-flame.md) I think he will come there.

# Old flame is gone
Now, just [arrange the sunset](030-golden-hour.md).
