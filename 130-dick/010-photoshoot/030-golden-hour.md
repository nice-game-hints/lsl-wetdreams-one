Dick would take a photo of Larry at the Pier 69 if he would have the perfect background: a sunset!

# Where do I get that?
Have you looked around? Artificial sunset anywhere?

# Where?
At the pawn shop. There is [a cardboard sunset](/050-pier69/020-pawnshop/01-panorama.md).

# I have the cardboard sunset
Great, give it to Dick. You will meet him at Hell's Pawn dance floor later.
