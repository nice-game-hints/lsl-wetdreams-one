You meet Anu in the Jail. If you want to meet her again, you have to [get back into the jail](/070-jail/040-back.md).

# What should I say to her?
She appreciates the truth.

# So?
Say that the smart phone says you need to meet.
Tell that you know BJ and Faith.
Say that you were up in the tower with them.
Tell that you found the smartphone.

She gives you a USB drive to copy information.
