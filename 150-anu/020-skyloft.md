You meet up with Anu at Salon de Lézard. You should get access to Prune Skyloft.

# How?
Maybe Anu has some ideas?

# Back to Prune?
Good idea! Go there and find BJ talking to the nerds. Click on BJ.

# He lost it?
Now you can go and find his lost access card.

# Where?
Go to Salon de Lézard.

# I am there
There are new hot spots. I can't give you the exact place as it changes from play to play. You have to just try them.

# List them for me
Okay:
 * Gap in floorboards
 * Door mat
 * Tip jar
 * Pillow
 * Old chair

# Found it!
Meet with Anu [at the Skyloft](/030-prune/070-skyloft.md).
