Your phone is on top of the safe. Out of reach.

# How to get it
Some kind of tool would suffice. What do you have?

# I have...
A plunger laying on the ground? It does not have a handler.

# A handle
Have you... umm... [talked with your cellmate](010-getout.md).

# I got the handle!
Nice. Attach the cucumber to the plunger.

# Ready!
You would need to get it back. Get the string of lights and attach it to the plunger.

# Hook shot
Use it to get your phone back.
