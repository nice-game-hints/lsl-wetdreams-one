You want to get _back_ into the jail? You just got out?

# I miss Tuck
Sure! Well, why don't you go talk to her.

# That's what I am trying to do!
You can talk to her other way, also.

# Phone?
No, you silly. Talk to her through the barred window.
Ask her how she manages to keep sneaking back.

# I got instructions
It is a mirror, with the instructions.

# Where is the entrance?
She said that the tunnels were used for laundry ironing after the prohibition.

# Laundry?
Any washing machines come to mind?

# Laundry!
The tunnel begins from Lefty's back room. Follow the instructions ^[ You have to look at the mirror in your inventory first. ].

Okay okay.
