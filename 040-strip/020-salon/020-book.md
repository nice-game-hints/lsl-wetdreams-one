There's an old book in the Salon du LÃ©zard. It must be valuable. At least to someone.

# Gimme!
It is protected by a glass.

# How to break it?
You been to opera? You know the cliches?

# High pitch?
Yup. I think the developers have placed the grammophone next to the glass display just for that reason.

# I need...
... a record, yes.

# Where?
I think there was one [in Lefty's jukebox](/020-leftys/055-record.md).

# I have it
Now, play it.

# Nothing happens
Move the horn so that it points to the glass. Use the grammophone. Get the rare book.
