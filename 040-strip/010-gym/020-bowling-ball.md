That's Steven's bowling ball.

# Gimme!
You could replace it with something.

# With what?
There is a melon for sale at the QuikiMart ^[ It is in the Leisure Suite's back room. ] [You need to have the PrunePal.](/030-prune/050-apply.md)

# I bought the melon
Cool. Can you swap the bowling ball with it?

# It doesn't have holes
You need something to make holes into it.

# What tool?
It has something to do with partying hard! You know who party hard!

# Who?
Computer scientists and their assistants! In trendy mobile companies!

# Yeah, sure
Get [Nari](/140-nari/index.md) out, first.

# She's out
Search [the Prune office](/030-prune/060-office/index.md).

# I found something
You found the assistant in the ball pit? Search more closely. ^[ Click on the assistant again. You will find a corkscrew. ]

# I have the corkscrew
You can use that to make holes into the melon. It now looks like a bowling ball.

# It does!
Go and swap Steven's bowling ball with the bowling melon.
