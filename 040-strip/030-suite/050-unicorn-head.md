Cool unicorn head at the Leisure Suite! It could be used for all kinds of kinky plays.

# She doesn't let me
Yeah, it's the last one and not for sale.

# But I want it
Hmm.. let's see if you are far enough in your adventure. Does the name "Nari" say anything to you? If not, come back later.

# Yes, of course
Great! Then you have a change to get that cool unicorn head.

# Again, she doesn't let me
Maybe build a replacement?

# A replacement?
Replacement head. White unicorn head.

# First, I need a head
There's one in Lefty's ^[ You get it when you visit [the old laboratory](/080-old-lab/010-back.md) first. ].

# I got the moose head
Now, it was supposed to be _white_.

# White...
Use the white wash cream on it. ^[ You find white wash cream from the Gym. ]

# White head
Now, it needs the rainbow horn.

# Rainbow
You have the bone in your inventory. It is rainbow-y. Use it on the moose head.

# It is not sharp enough
You need it sharpened. You need a tool that sharpens stuff.

# Sharpener
There is a pencil sharpener in [the Prune office](/030-prune/040-access.md). Get [Nari](/140-nari/index.md) out of there, first.

# I sharpened it!
Now, stick it into the moose head, you have a replacement head!

# Ta-daa
Take the unicorn head and put the unihorny-moose on its place.
