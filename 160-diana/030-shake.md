You need to [fix the brewashing machine first](/020-lefty/030-backroom/030-fix-brewery.md).

# It is fixed
Well, then. Insert the ingrediends (kale, cucumber, expired soy, brotein powder) into the brewashing machine. Then, when they are all in, use the machine (just click on it).

# It is mixing them!
Great! Now pour yourself a fresh batch of that protein shake.

# Where?
The tap on Lefty's desk.

# Where?!
Oh, you meant where you should pour it _into_? A container, of course ^[ Take the thermal jug in front of Prune HQ and use that. ].

# I got it
Give it to Diana.
