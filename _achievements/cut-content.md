Try to trim some beards.

# Trim?
You will get a trimmer at some point.

# Where?
You have to [get Erin out](/110-erin/040-stripper.md), first.

## I have the trimmer
Use the trimmer on one of the bearded guys in the Lounge de Lizard cafe.

You have to do this _before_ you trim some bush with the trimmer.
