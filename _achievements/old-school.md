# Hint
When you start a new game select "More than old enough." You have to answer some questions to "prove you are adult".

This is a nod to old Leisure Suit Larry games that had this same kind of questionnaire in the beginning.

To get the achievement answer four questions correctly in a row. You have unlimited retries.
