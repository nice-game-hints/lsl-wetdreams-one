Help the game to pass the Bechdel Test.

# What is Bechdel test?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test): The Bechdel Test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man.

# Two women?
Well, there are women in this game, that's for sure. But when do they talk to each other?

## When?
Lemma and Erin will talk to each other at some point. That is your chance to shut up.

## What should I do?
Nothing. Let Lemma and Erin talk to each other without interference. Then you get the achievement.
