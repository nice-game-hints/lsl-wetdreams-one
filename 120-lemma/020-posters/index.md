Lemma gave you a stack of posters. Hang them on walls to help her spread the word.

You _could_ also go to Lefty's and throw them all into the trash bin. But you wouldn't do that, wouldn't you? ^[ You get an achievement if you try this. ]

# Where should I put the posters then?
All around. There are those empty spaces that you can see with space bar. You should do this while you solve other puzzles.

# List the poster locations
Okay, here goes:
 * At the Salon du LÃ©zard inside wall
 * Leisure Suite counter ^[ Say it is for a new sex toy. ]
 * The wall right to the gym entrance
 * Inside the gym
 * Outside Lefty's
 * Inside Lefty's, next to the jukebox
 * [In the toilet, at Lefty's](toilet-poster.md)
 * Lefty's back room back wall
 * Pier 69 fence, next to the entrance
 * At the funfair, behind the pawnshop (You get a conspiracy pamphlet)
 * Outside Prune HQ, in front of the righ "ball"
 * Hell's Pawn posters, the wall of the police station
