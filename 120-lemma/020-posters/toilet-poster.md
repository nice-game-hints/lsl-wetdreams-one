title: The poster in the toilet
---

There is a place for a poster ^[ You get posters from Lemma.] in Lefty's toilet.

# The poster won't stick
I don't want to know what's on those walls. Maybe you should use some items to stick the poster on to the wall.

# What items?
Well, you could use _thumbtacks_, or similar sharp objects. Look around.

## Tell me what should I use to stick the poster
Take the darts from the dart table. Use the darts to stick the poster.
