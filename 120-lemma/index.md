Lemma is a rocker girl. Larry would like to (shocking, I know) date her.

She is ready to date you after her concert. You need to:
 * [Distribute the posters](020-posters/index.md)
 * [Get the drummer back](010-drummer/index.md)
 * And, after finding the drummer, [get her guitar back](030-guitar/index.md)

# She needs one more thing
A smoke machine? Hmm... what could work. Cigarettes?

# No?
There was that one guy smoking [an e-cigarette](/050-pier69/010-smoking-guy.md) at the funfair.

# I have the e-piece
Give it to Lemma. It will work as a smoke machine.
