Lemma's drummer is missing. He wanted to go to drink in this run-down bar.

# Lefty's!
Detective, aren't you. Go ask Lefty about the drummer.

# He doesn't remember
You need more descriptions about him. Name, clothes, facial features, character description, peculiar habits...

# Yeah yeah, I get it!
Good, well, find these things out about him.

# From where?
Lemma, of course. Talk to her and ask his name. Also ask a picture of him.

# Interesting clues
So, at this point you have a name (Stix) and that the hipsters might know more. Go talk to them (remember to first ask Lemma) about Stix.

# More clues!
You should now know that:
 * He smokes (Any idea where I can find him?)
 * He is wearing old-fashioned biker jacket (What was he wearing?)
 * His unkempt beard was gray and he has a red bandana (What color was his hair?)
 * He had a huge fight with Lemma (Know anything else about Stix?)

# These are not enough
Yeah, Lefty needs more. About the huge fight...

# Yes?
Talk to Lemma about it. Stix has issues with alcohol and gambling.

# And the smoking?
Find out what cigarette he likes ^[ Search the ash tray outside the Salon ].

# Camel Toe!
Never heard of it, either. Now you should have enough hints for Lefty.

# I had
Lefty told you about [Pier 69](/050-pier69/index.md).
