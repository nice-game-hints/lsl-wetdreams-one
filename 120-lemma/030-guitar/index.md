Lemma's guitar is missing. You should help her. Ask her for more hints.

# Guitar case?
Open it. Take the matchbox. You can now go to the [Hell's Pawn nightclub](/060-hellspawn/index.md).

# There's the guitar!
Talk to Cébé, the bouncer. He says he bought it from the lady at Leisure Suite. Go ask Bea about the guitar.

# Pawnbroker lady?
There is a pawn shop at Pier 69. Ask her about the guitar.

# It was him!
Stix! Make him confess! Tell him that the bouncer does not believe that the guitar was stolen.

# He doesn't want to leave
