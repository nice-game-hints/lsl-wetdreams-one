Lemma's guitar is missing. You should help her. Ask her for more hints.

# Guitar case?
Open it. Take the matchbox. You can now go to the [Hell's Pawn nightclub](/060-hellspawn/index.md).

# There's the guitar!
Talk to Cébé, the bouncer. He says he bought it from the lady at Leisure Suite. Go ask Bea about the guitar.

# She swapped it
She swapped it with a pawnbroker lady. There is a pawn shop at Pier 69. Ask her about the guitar.

# It was him!
Stix! Make him confess! Tell him that the bouncer does not believe that the guitar was stolen.

# He doesn't want to leave
[Break his slut machine.](010-stop-gambling.md)

# The winning streak is over!
Ask him to explain the situation to Cébé.

# He is afraid
[He needs a drink.](020-drink.md)

# Got it
He is now ready to meet you at the Hell's Pawn.

# Cébé wants something in return
Something that has to do with Queef, a famous rock band.

# What?
Look around at Salon du Lézard.

# The shroud?
[The Shroud of Urine is the sacred regalia for _Queef fans_.](/040-strip/020-salon/010-shroud.md)

# I have it
Good! Give it to Cébé. You can have the guitar now.
