After Stix has [stopped gambling] he would need a drink. They only sell those non-alcoholic drinks at the funfair.

# Who would sell Larry a drink?
Well, Lefty, of course! Ask him to give you the strongest drink he has.

# Virgin...
Well, I be damned. Lefty is serving non-alcoholic drinks. Stix won't drink _that_!

# What to do?
Could you make it alcoholic, though?

# How?
There is alcohol in all kinds of places.

# Like?
Like cleaning utensils. And disinfectional wipes ^[ You find disinfectional wipes from the first aid cabin at the gym. ].

# I have the wipes
Soak the wipes in the _mocktail_ to make it a real cocktail. Give it to Stix.
