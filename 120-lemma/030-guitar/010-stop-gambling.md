Stix is wasting his money to that _slut machince_. Maybe you could help him.

# How?
Like, breaking the machine?

# What to do
You see the power cable at the bottom of the machine? Someone could break it.

# Someone?
Some small animal, for example. A rodent, maybe.

# A rodent?
There is a rat next to the Hell's Pawn. [Catch it.](/060-hellspawn/030-rat.md)

# I have the rat
Great, now put it into the machine.

# How?
From the hatch. Open it first ^[ Use a quarter dollar. You find it on the table at Lefty's toilet. ].

# The hatch is open
Now, put the rat into the open repair hatch.
