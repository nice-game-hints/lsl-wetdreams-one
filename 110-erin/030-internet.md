Erin is sharing the internet with Lefty. Larry, the Internet technician, will fix this!

# How?
Did you talk to Lefty?

# Yes?
He said the new special edition router has a home entertainment system.

# You mean?
The jukebox is the internet router. You have to select the option where Larry understands that the jukebox is the internet router.

# How to fix it?
Have you tried...

# ..yes?
...turning it off and on again?

# Hmm...
Pull the plug from that thing.

# Nice one!
Oh, your first death? There will be more, no worries. Protect yourself, first.

# With what?
With [the rubber gloves](/110-erin/020-parcel/index.md)!
