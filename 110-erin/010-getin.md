title: Getting into Erin's apartment
---

Erin lives in the apartment above Lefty's.

# How to get in there?
Go up the stairs from [the back room](/020-leftys/030-backroom/010-door.md).

# Knock, knock
She doesn't appreciate your jokes.

# What to do?
Maybe if you match her [in Timber](/030-prune/020-timber-profile/index.md)?

# Matched!
Great, now she lets you in.
