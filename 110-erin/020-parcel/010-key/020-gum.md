Dry chewing gum ^[ You find it from the bar table at Lefty's] does not stick to anything.

# Make it wetter
Someone should chew it. Have you tried to offer it to anyone?

# No?
There is one animal chewing his bone.

# You mean?
The stray dog outside Lefty's. Give the chewing gum to it.

# It is chewing it
Now, take it back. Like you take a toy from a stray dog's mouth. What could happen?

# I died...
Hmm.. maybe you need some replacement for the dog.

# Like what?
Go check the Gym (at the Strip). There is a more _willing_ dog. Take its toy and give it to the stray dog to get your gum, or the sticky bone, back.
