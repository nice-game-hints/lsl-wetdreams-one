title: Find the key to the jewelry box
---

Erin's jewelry box key is missing.

# Oh, bummer
What are you waiting for? Go find the key!

# Where?
She had it last time she left the house.

# So?
Maybe it is fallen somewhere outside Lefty's.

# Like?
Did you look at the sewer? There is something sparkling there.

# I can't lift it
You would need more body muscle. For now, maybe some kind of tool would help.

# What?
Like, a string and a something that sticks to the key.

# So, what do I need?
 * The string ^[ Take the shoelace from the working shoe outside Lefty's ]
 * Sticky subject ^[ Take the chewing gum under the bar table inside Lefty's ]

# I have those
Great, combine them. First, [make the chewing gum wetter](020-gum.md). You now have a tool to pick up the key.

# Sticky...
You have the sticky bone. Now, combine _that_ with the shoelace.

# The shoelace is too short!
Extend it with some other short thread ^[ Go to the Salon de LÃ©zard (at the Strip). Take a vegan licorice wheel].
Combine the short shoelace with the other short thread.

# I have a long thread now
Attach the sticky bone into it and get the key from the drain. You get to keep the sticky bone.
