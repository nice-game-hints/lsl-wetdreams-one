The ghettoblaster has a casette in it. But it is finished.

# Casette?
You know, old techonology. You had to rewind them when they played to the end.

# Rewind
Like, turn the round things with something. Usually the player has a rewind button.

# Well, not this.
Take the casette from the casette deck. Look at it.

# It is still in the end
Well. There were other ways to rewind a casette, too.

# Like?
You could stick a pencil into one of the holes and rotate so that the tape is in the beginning.

# Neat!
Take a pencil from the shelf and use it on the casette.

# Rewound!
Put the casette back into the deck and listen it.
