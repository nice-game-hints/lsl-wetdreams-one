You need to turn the computer on. Or is it a TV, actually?

# TV?
What do you use to turn on the television?

# Remote control?
Yes! Take one from the body on the left.

# I have it
And insert batteries ^[ They are on top of the tank. ] into the remote control. You can now use it on the computer.

# Nothing happens
Maybe there is instruction somewhere. Like _audible instructions_.

# Where?
[Play the casette.](030-casette.md)

# Oh!
Do as you were instructed. Use the remote control to the computer and insert the code 12345.
