Beam me up, Scotty! You want back to where you came from?

# Yes!
Your last ordeal broke the electrics from the system. You would need to find the junction box, first.

# Where it is?
Near the manhole cover. Follow the wire.

# You mean?
In [the lush bush](/020-leftys/090-lushbush.md), yes.

# Found it!
Look at it.

# A battery compartment?
Yeah, it is missing a battery. You'll find one eventually. Visit Hell's Pawn, first.

# I have visited. Where is the battery?
In the Prune Tech Lab. Help [Nari to test the prototype](/140-nari/020-prototype/index.md).

# I have the battery
Good. Insert it into the junction box. Beam me up ^[ Use the manhole cover. ]!
