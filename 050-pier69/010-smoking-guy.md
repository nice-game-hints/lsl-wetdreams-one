Smokey Bear is smoking that E-peace pipe.

# I want it!
Of course. Those are healthy for you.

# Really?
At least Smokey hasn't heard anything bad about them.

# Right
Maybe you could change his mind.

# How?
With some conspiracy theories!

# Ooh, goody. Where?
Have you distributed some posters, already? You can start from here, the funfair. ^[ Behind the pawnshop is a poster wall. You get a conspiracy pamphlet. ]

# I have the pamphlet
Now, give it to Smokey.

# He needs a substitute
Substitute for an e-cigarette?

# Yes
Like... a cigarette?

# Oh, right
Give him the pack of Camel Toe. You got the e-cigarette. Happy smoking!
