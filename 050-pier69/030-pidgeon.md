Nice pidgeon. You could feed it some human food.

# Like what?
I think the pidgeons like bread ^[ You get bread from the Salon du LÃ©zard. Ask it from the counter (ask for beer and then the menu). ]?

# I have bread
Give it to the pidgeon.

# It doesn't like it
Maybe add some flavor into it, then. From your inventory.

# What?
Combine the bread with the Barbarian Brew leftovers. Give it to the dove.
