Waltraud is selling the cardboard panorama at the pawnshop. It costs 100$, cash.

# Or?
Or an extraordinary second-hand object.

# Hmm..
I have an idea. But first you need to [get Dick away from the Leisure Suite](/130-dick/010-photoshoot/020-flame.md).

# He is gone from there
Did you visit the Leisure Suite after that?

# Hmm... yes?
There are some (krhm..) second-hand objects.

# Yuck, cheesy
Yeah, but maybe that would suffice. Give the second hand dildo to Waltraud.

# No!
It needs to be something else... second-hand...

# How about the sign?
Well, you can try... Give the second hand sign to Waltraud.

# It worked!
Whaddayouknow? Buy the photo panorama then.
