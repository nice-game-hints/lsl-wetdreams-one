A thousand dollars action figure

# Quite expensive
Life is... It has a removable gold bikini and the air inside is from the 70s!

# Air?
Yes, the air really makes it exquisite. Think about it. Air from the 70s.

# So, the air makes it expensive?
Yes, you could say so.

# So, if I...
What? Don't you dare.

# ...remove tha air?
You can't do that. What would you use.

# Well, I have my...
what?

# ...dart!
From Lefty's dart table? Oh noes! Don't you punch a hole into the packaging! Letting the expensive air out.

# I did it!
Now it only costs _one dollar_. Thanks a bunch!

# I don't have any money
Kjeh, kjeh. Servers you right. Don't you go to Lefty's and grab that dollar bill from the toilet table.

# Thanks!
D'oh! Oh well, you got the figurine, at least.
