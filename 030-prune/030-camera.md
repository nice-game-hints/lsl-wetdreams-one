Think about it! Instant camera. No need to store the pictures into a digital memory!

# Yeah, revolutionary
It is! But you wouldn't buy it for yourself. Come back when you know someone who would need one ^[ Try to buy the Shroud of Urine from Salon du LÃ©zard. ]

# I kwow who needs one
Good. Ask the nerds about it.

# They want something
A figurine? Where do you get that?

# Where, indeed?
Have you visited [the pier](/120-lemma/010-drummer/010-find.md)?

# Yes
There is the pawnshop. [Buy it from there.](/050-pier69/020-pawnshop/02-figurine.md)

# I have it
Then give it to the nerds. They will appreciate it. You can grab a camera now.
