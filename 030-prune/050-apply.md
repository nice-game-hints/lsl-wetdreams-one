The brainiacs will tell you that Prune is hiring a new intern. They don't have the internship contracts lying around.

# Intern contract
Try to find an internship contract. _Any_ internship contract.

# Any hints?
Check out the Hell's Pawn bar. There are flyers for stripper internship.

# Larry?
No, you silly. That is an internship contract. Just what you need for Prune.

# But it is not Prune contract
You should make it look like one.

# How?
Like, stamping Prune's logo into it. Their logo really looks like... umm... you know.

# I don't, what?
A vagina! There, I said it. You need _a vagina stamp_.

# A what?
Visit Erin's apartment. She left you a package.

# Oh, that
Yes. Use the fleshlight to stamp the paper.

# I need ink
There's ink in the police's table at [the jail](/070-jail/040-back.md).

# I got ink into my stamper
Nice. Then just stamp the contract and show it to the nerds at Prune Store.
