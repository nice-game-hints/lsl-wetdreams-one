You can't do anything in the office until [Nari](/140-nari/index.md) is out of there.

# She's out
Take the ball.

# Hmm...
It is stick in that assistant's mouth.

# Yeah
You would have to hit it with something heavy.

# The slide?
Yes, that object must be slid down the slide. You can slide objects from the tech lab, above.

# What object?
Something _round_ and heavy.

# Like?
Like a melon? ^[ You can buy a melon from QuikiMart. ]

# It is not heavy enough
Something similar, then.

# What?
[Steven's bowling ball.](/040-strip/010-gym/020-bowling-ball.md)

# I have the bowling ball
Great! Go to the tech lab and drop the bowling ball into the slide.
