The apartment at the upstairs would be available for rent, after [Erin](/110-erin/index.md) moves out.

Ask Lefty about the room. You should first [fix the brewery](030-backroom/030-fix-brewery.md).

# It's fixed
Okay. Lefty had to change the recipe for Barbarian Brew. [Could you deliver the needed ingredients for him?](070-barbarian-brew.md)
