There is an old coin machine at Lefty's toilet. Grab some coins from the table and test it.

# It does not accept dollars
Hmm... you would need golden doubloon.

# Where would I get that?
You could make one. Let's get back to this after you have talked to Lemma and [found her drummer](/120-lemma/010-drummer/010-find.md).

# I found him
At the funfair? Did you even look around?

# I did!
There is the embossing machine that says (if you look at it) you can _make your own golden doubloon replica_ with it. I don't think Lefty's machine notices if the coin is replica.

# But I need gold
Right. Have you distributed any posters, yet? ^[ Go put a poster onto the backroom wall at Lefty's. Take the golden tooth. ]

# I have gold
Put it into the embossing machine and press yourself a golden doubloon. You can use it in the coin machine.

# What to take from there?
The only working option is the sauce.

# Where to pour it on?
There is an old corndog next to the pawn booth at the funfair. Put it into the slot and select the sauce. You now have a nostalgic corndog.
