The lush bush is too thick. Maybe you could trim it.

# With what?
There's a hedge trimmer in Erin's apartment.

# She doesn't let me
You have to [get Erin out](/110-erin/040-stripper.md), first.

# She's out
Well, take the trimmer and trim that bush.

# A box?
It is a junction box. Notice that the wire from it goes to the manhole cover.
