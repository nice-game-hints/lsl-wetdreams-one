The washing machine has stopped its program and there is a mysterious tunnel instead.

# Any instructions?
That's what you should find, don't you?

# Hmpf..
Fine, I will help you find the instructions.

# Thank you
Go talk to Tuck through the barred window (next to Hell's Pawn).
Ask her how she manages to keep sneaking back.

# I got...
A mirror, with the instructions. You're welcome.

# Wait!
What? Just get into the tunnel ^[ You have to look at the mirror in your inventory first. ] and follow the instructions :

_To the left the water flows. Up the pipe the cocktail goes. More than trees can get the axe. To get back home, hey, just relax._

# Help me
Okay okay.

_To the left the water flows._

Select the option "To the left..."

# Left he goes
_Up the pipe the cocktail goes._

Select the option "Straight ahead past the straw."

# Straight he goes
_More than trees can get the axe._

Select the option "...take the axe and chop the troll in half!"

# Chop!
_To get back home, hey, just relax._

Select the option "Make myself comfortable on the chaise longue."
