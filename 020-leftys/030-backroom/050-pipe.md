Something has eaten the brewashing pipe.

# Where to get a new one?
Now, before we go any further, have you visited Hell's Pawn front yard ^[ Go talk to Lemma and find her drummer ], already?

# Yes, I get there
Well, there is your answer.

# What?
Take the drain pipe from the alley. Use it to fix the dripping brewashing pipe.
