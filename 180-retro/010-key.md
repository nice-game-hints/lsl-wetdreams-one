Retro Larry needs a key into the bathroom door. Look into the lock.

# It's on the other side
Yeah, you know the old trick.

# What?
You drop the key to a newspaper that is pushed under the door.

# Newspaper
There's quite fresh issue of Ballstreet Journal on the floor.

# I got it
Stick it under the door.

# It's too wet
[Dry it](020-dry.md)

# It's dry
Stick it under the door. Push the key onto it.

# With what?
Did you [fix the sink](040-sink.md), already?

# Yes
Take the eel, it gets stiff. Use the stiff eel on the lock.

# The key!
Click on the journal and then the key.
