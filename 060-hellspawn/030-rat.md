Catching the rat hiding behind the dumpster is most logical of all puzzles.

# It is?
Yeah, sure, why not.

# Okay, hit it...
Hmm.. where do I begin? Before the rat you sould take care of more important things. Like [taking a decent Timber profile picture](/130-dick/010-photoshoot.md).

# I did it
So, Dick is away from the Leisure Suite. Was the photo cheesy?

# What do you mean?
By logic: cheese, rats like cheese.

# Okay?
Take a second hand dildo from Leisure Suite. It smells like cheese. Logically, you can lure the rat with it.

# I sure can!
But you would need to catch it into something.

# Like?
Something extra large ^[ Grab the XL condom from Erin's bed. ].

# I have the "trap"
Great! Logically, condoms are used to catch rats. Can you catch the rat into the condom.

# No
Okay. Make the condom cheesy by inserting the dildo into it.

# Uhm.. okay...
Ta-daa. Would it catch the rat now?

# It doesn't stay open
Well, logically, attach something to keep the opening... open.

# Like?
A toilet paper roll, sigh. Isn't that logical? Now you can catch the rat. And refund the game!
