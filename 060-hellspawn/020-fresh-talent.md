Cébé is always looking for some new fresh extraordinary acts.

# Larry?
Fresh!

# Who?
Have you talked with Erin? As soon as you get [her parcel](/110-erin/020-parcel/index.md) and [fix the Internet](/110-erin/030-internet.md) I think she would be ready to apply here.

# She is
Mention her name to Cébé.

# He needs proof
Hmm... nothing works. Maybe you should ask Erin about this. Get back to her apartment.

# What's that?
There is some peep recording her! Cut it!

# Cut?
Yeah, like cut the recording.

# You mean?
Oh, cut the string. Yeah, that's better. Use the hedge trimmer. Show the camera to Cébé.

# Where is it?
It fell down.

# Where?
In the trash can. Get the camera and show it to Cébé.

# She got the job
Yeah, but he needs something extraordinary. Talk to Erin.

# Extraordinary
She came up with a good idea. But she needs that one certain book.

# Where is it?
Check out [the book on display](/040-strip/020-salon/020-book.md) at Salon du Lézard.

# I got the book
Great! Give it to Erin. You'll meet her at the Hell's Pawn.
