Matchmaking! Oh, goody. Lance needs to apologize Dick, first.

# What did he do?
Go ask Dick. Ask what happened to the gift.

# In the ocean?
So, Lance threw the ring into the ocean. Wouldn't it be perfect to get it back.

# Yeah?
All kinds of junk there in the sea.

# Plastic!
Yes, and flotsam!

# So?
The Pier 69 is next to the sea.

# It is
Search the flotsam, behind the cardboard sunsset. Now that Dick told you where the ring is, Larry will search it. Show the ring to Lance.

# He resents
But now he wants a bottle of [Doom PÃ©rignon](070-doom.md).

# I have the bottle
Show it to Lance.

# Marriage, here we come!
