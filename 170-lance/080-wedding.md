What is a Leisure Suit Larry game without a wedding. Nothing!
As soon as [Lance gives you the permit](060-dick.md) go and arrange everything.

# I need a priest
[Find a priest.](090-priest.md)

# I have a priest
Then you have the key, also. Open the wedding lectern at the Pier 69 and prepare everything.

# What was it again?
 * Book of love in its place. ^[ Put the book of love to the stand. ]
 * Light the candles. ^[ Take the candles from the cabin and light them with your matches. ]
 * Old wedding arch could use a little pepping up, like flowers. ^[ You find flowers from the bush in front of Hell's Pawn. ]
 * Put the champaign on ice. ^[ Put the Doom PÃ©rignon into the ice bucket. ]

# All done!
You have a ring for Dick? ^[ Unglog the [dried up fountain](/060-hellspawn/060-lube-fountain.md) at Hell's Pawn. ]

# Yes!
Go tell Lance. And then lure Dick to the pier.

# The wedding!
Do as you are told.

# Guide me
 * Use the bear-shaped remote to the animanitronic bear.
 * Give the washed up wedding ring to Lance
 * Give the lubed wedding ring to Dick
