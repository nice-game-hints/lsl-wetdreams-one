Yeah, he isn't. But how can you convince _him_ about it?

# How?
Maybe show him a hideous woman body.

# Like?
Your old friend, of course.

# Friend?
From the first ever Leisure Suit Larry game!

# I don't...
The blow-up doll, of course!

# Oh, right.. But it is broken
Fix it ^[ You can fix it with the patch you find from Lefty's toilet. ].

# Fixed!
Inflate it! ^[ Inflate it with Prune balloons you find outside their HQ. ]
