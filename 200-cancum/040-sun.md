The prophecy says that the man in white suit should stand in sun beam.

# The sunscreen is blocking it
There is a loose patch.

# Yeah?
Make a hole there.

# With the sharp wood?
It doesn't work. Some other substance.

# What?
Cerveza! ^[ Order one from Lefto. First click on the "Cerveza" poster. ]

# It's too high
You know what bugs me?

# What?
Those narcomaniacs spreading their syringes in children's playgrounds.

# What does this have to do?
Children playground?

# The sand castle!
Go dig the syringe from there.

# I have it
Take some beer to the syringe and then spurt it on the loose patch.
