The previous enter to the villa was just a vision! You know what to do.

# It looks different!
It's almost the same. Open the window ^[ Use the brick to break the window. ] and remove the blockage ^[ Use the watering can on the dry soil to get the paddle. Use the paddle on the trash can. ].

# I'm in
Get yourself down. The righmost door.

# Where's the switch?
Strange... Have you looked around?

# Yes!
Not well enough. Walk left. The switch is on the left side this time.
